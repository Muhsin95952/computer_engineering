      How to create <span class="big">style sheet</span> to alter an HTML
      element?
    </p>
    <p class="answer">
      The Style assignment process can be accomplished with the
      &lt;STYLE&gt;...&lt;/STYLE&gt; tags. The syntax for making the assignment
      is simple. Between &lt;STYLE&gt; and &lt;/STYLE&gt;, HTML tags to which
      styles are to be assigned are to be listed ad each tag with a pair of
      curly brackets in which specific style attributes are to be specified.
      This &lt;STYLE&gt; tag should be within &lt;HEAD&gt;...&lt;/HEAD&gt;
      element.
